## Traffic Sign Classifier

Overview
---
In this project we aim to classify the German road traffic signs. We use tensorfzlow as our deep learning framework to train our convolutional neural network CNN and python as the scripting language. Before training the model we start by processing the dataset images using bumpy and openCV.
